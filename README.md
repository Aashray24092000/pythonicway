## Getting Started

What does _pythonic_ mean? ~ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25011492/5373017):

- Exploiting the feature of the Python language to produce code that is clear, concise, and maintainable.
- Code that doesn't just get the syntax right but that follows the conventions of the Python community and uses the language in the way it is intended to be used.

The repository contains two directories:

- _Normal way_ : Python programs written in a way that you'd usually see in other common languages such as Java/C++.

- _Pythonic way_: The same programs as above, but redesigned to be more "pythonic".

The _Zen of Python_ (PEP20), Tim Peters:

_Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
Simple is better than complex.  
Complex is better than complicated.  
Flat is better than nested.  
Sparse is better than dense.  
Readability counts.  
Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.  
Although practicality beats purity.  
Errors should never pass silently.  
Unless explicitly silenced.  
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.  
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.  
Now is better than never.  
Although never is often better than \*right\* now.  
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
Namespaces are one honking great idea — let’s do more of those!_
